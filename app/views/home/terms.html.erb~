  to  such disputes and / or our service. If you are a California resident, you  
  waive  California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: &quot;A general release does

have  materially affected his settlement with the debtor.&quot;  </p>

  license  from xiggit.  Correspondingly, Posting  Agents are not  
  permitted  to post Content on behalf of others, to cause Content to  
  be  so posted, or otherwise access the Service to facilitate posting  
  Content  on behalf of others, except with express permission or  
  license  from xiggit.</p> 
 
<p>8.  NO SPAM POLICY</p>

  xiggit  email addresses or through xiggit computer systems, which is  
  expressly  prohibited by these Terms, may use or cause to be used servers  
  located  in California.  Any unauthorized use of xiggit  computer systems  
  is  a violation of these Terms and certain federal and state laws, including  
  without  limitation the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (18 U.S.C. Â§ 1030 et  
  seq.),  Section 502 of the California Penal Code and Section 17538.45 of the  
  California  Business and Professions Code.  Such  violations may subject the  
  sender  and his or her agents to civil and criminal penalties.</p> 
 
<p>9.  PAID POSTINGS</p> 
<p>We  may charge a fee to post Content in some areas of the Service. The fee 
  is  an access fee permitting Content to be posted in a designated area. 
  Each  party posting Content to the Service is responsible for said Content 
  and  compliance with the TOU. All fees paid will be non-refundable in the 
  event  that Content is removed from the Service for violating the TOU.</p> 
 
<p>10.  LIMITATIONS ON SERVICE</p> 
<p>You  acknowledge that xiggit may establish limits concerning use of the  
  Service,  including the maximum number of days that Content will be retained  
  by  the Service, the maximum number and size of postings, email messages, or  
  other  Content that may be transmitted or stored by the Service, and the  
  frequency  with which you may access the Service. You agree that xiggit  
  has  no responsibility or liability for the deletion or failure to store any  
  Content  maintained or transmitted by the Service. You acknowledge that  
  xiggit  reserves the right at any time to modify or discontinue the  
  Service  (or any part thereof) with or without notice, and that xiggit  
  shall  not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification,  
  suspension  or discontinuance of the Service.</p> 
 
<p>11.  ACCESS TO THE SERVICE</p> 
<p>xiggit  grants you a limited, revocable, nonexclusive license to access  
  the  Service for your own personal use.  This  license does not include:  
  (a)  access to the Service by Posting Agents; or (b) any collection,  
  aggregation,  copying, duplication, display or derivative use of the Service  
  nor  any use of data mining, robots, spiders, or similar data gathering and  
  extraction  tools for any purpose unless expressly permitted by xiggit.  
  A  limited exception to (b) is provided to general purpose internet search  
  engines  and non-commercial public archives that use such tools to gather  
  information  for the sole purpose of displaying hyperlinks to the Service,  
  provided  they each do so from a stable IP address or range of IP addresses  
  using  an easily identifiable agent and comply with our robots.txt file.  
  &quot;General  purpose internet search engine&quot; does not include a website or  
  search  engine or other service that specializes in classified listings  
  or  in any subset of classifieds listings such as jobs, housing, for sale,  
  services,  or personals, or which is in the business of providing classified  
  ad  listing services.</p> 
<p>xiggit  permits you to display on your website, or create a hyperlink  
  on  your website to, individual postings on the Service so long as such use  
  is  for noncommercial and/or news reporting purposes only (e.g., for use in  
  personal  web blogs or personal online media).  If  the total number of such  
  postings  displayed or linked to on your website exceeds one hundred (100)  
  postings,  your use will be presumed to be in violation of the TOU,  
  absent  express permission granted by xiggit to do so.   You may also  
  create  a hyperlink to the home page of xiggit sites so long as the  
  link  does not portray xiggit, its employees, or its affiliates in a  
  false,  misleading, derogatory, or otherwise offensive matter.</p> 

<p>Use  of the Service beyond the scope of authorized access granted to you by  
  xiggit  immediately terminates said permission or license.  In order to  
  collect,  aggregate, copy, duplicate, display or make derivative use of the  
  the  Service or any Content made available via the Service for other  
  purposes  (including commercial purposes) not stated herein, you must first  
  obtain  a license from xiggit.</p> 
 
<p>12.  TERMINATION OF SERVICE</p> 
<p>You  agree that xiggit, in its sole discretion, has the right (but not  
  the  obligation) to delete or deactivate your account, block your email or IP  
  address,  or otherwise terminate your access to or use of the Service (or any  
  part  thereof), immediately and without notice, and remove and discard any  
  Content  within the Service, for any reason, including, without limitation,  
  if  xiggit believes that you have acted inconsistently with the letter or  
  spirit  of the TOU. Further, you agree that xiggit shall not be liable  
  to  you or any third-party for any termination of your access to the Service.   
  Further,  you agree not to attempt to use the Service after said termination.   
  Sections  2, 4, 6 and 10-16 shall survive termination of the TOU.</p> 
 
<p>13.  PROPRIETARY RIGHTS</p>

  and  international treaties. Content displayed on or through the Service is

  by  posting Content to any public area of the Service, you automatically  
  grant,  and you represent and warrant that you have the right to grant, to  
  xiggit  an irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, fully paid, worldwide  
  license  to use, copy, perform, display, and distribute said Content and to  
  prepare  derivative works of, or incorporate into other works, said Content,  
  and  to grant and authorize sublicenses (through multiple tiers) of the  
  foregoing.  Furthermore, by posting Content to any public area of the Service,  
  you  automatically grant xiggit all rights necessary to prohibit any
