Hey Kickstarter!

My name is Benjamin Shyong, and I'm a rising junior at the University of Pennsylvania.  But my heart is still in California!

In my two years of college, I've always been disappointed that there isn't a quick and painless way to buy and sell textbooks.
Last semester, I bought a book on Ebay.  After seeing my shipping address, the seller contacted me, "We're on the same campus!  Heck we're in the same dorm..."
That was the last straw.  Students shouldn't need to use Ebay when next semester's students on campus need those books!

I picked up some programming books a few months ago and began to learn web programming in the spare time that I had. (I'm good with computers, but I've never programmed in my life.)

Instead of doing an internship or taking a position in a resarch lab, I decided to dedicate my summer to building an amazing web app that will help all of us buy and sell textbooks and more.
I am planning some great features such as a price comparison tool, and more that will help students nationwide 

For rewards, I can provide t-shirts, stickers, and other swag.

To spread the word, I have some friends that can film, so we are planning to run some funny shorts on youtube.
Using the traditional social media sites, hopefully the web app will spread by word of mouth as our early adopters tell their friends!

The demo is updated whenever I push new changes to Heroku!

and in the future, it may be possible to partner with local businesses to provide some great deals to students.
